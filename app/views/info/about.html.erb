<p>The Cents idea is to help prepare potential and current college students face the realities of their educational choices. There are a lot of graduates that have entered the workforce with a large amount of debt and without the prospect of jobs to allow them to pay off that debt. Our tool will provide users information, in a very intuitive way, that will allow students to see the impact of their educational choices. Some examples could be how much debt they will accumulate, how much, on average they will make once they graduate and how their finances will breakdown with these two things in mind.</p>
